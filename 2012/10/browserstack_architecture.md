# BrowserStack Support for Testacular

----

So recently I've started working on [Testacular][1] and one of the
features that where requested is support for [BrowserStack][2]. I
wanted to implement it but I had no account with them so I've just
mailed the support and asked if I could have a test account with api
access for creating this feature. (Only paid accounts usually get
access via the api) And sure enough they were nice enough and I had my
free account setup after a few hours!

## Part 1 - Architecture

### User Interface or "What goes into the config file?"
